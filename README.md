# Sorting-in-Assembly
Sorting 5, 2 byte numbers in assembly

The way the logic works is:

Load 1 and 2
Compare 
If they donâ€™t need to switch compare 2 and 3. If they need to switch go back to 1 and 2.
This will keep on going and you exit the loop once you make it to the last 2 numbers to compare without needing to switch.
